QUIZ ANSWER KEY

 1.  Adjectives primarily function as modifiers of nouns and pronouns, providing additional information about them. They describe
     a noun or pronoun’s qualities, quantities, or characteristics.
 2.  Descriptive adjectives describe the qualities or characteristics of a noun or pronoun (e.g., fast bike), while quantitative
     adjectives specify the quantity or amount (e.g., 20 rupees).
 3.  Proper adjectives are derived from proper nouns and describe a noun specifically; an example is Indian in Indian players.
 4.  The four demonstrative adjectives are this, that, these, and those. This and these refer to things close by, with this used
     for singular nouns and these for plural nouns. That and those refer to things farther away, with that used for singular nouns
     and those for plural nouns.
 5.  Possessive adjectives show ownership or possession; examples include my, his, and our.
 6.  Interrogative adjectives are used to ask questions about nouns or pronouns; examples include which phone and whose truck.
 7.  Indefinite adjectives modify nouns in a non-specific or uncertain way; examples include some, a few, and any.
 8.  Compound adjectives are formed by joining two or more words, often with a hyphen or quotation marks (e.g. seven-foot-long and
     broken-down).
 9.  Absolute adjectives describe a state or quality that cannot be graded or intensified further, making them incomparable; an
     example is dead or unique.
 10. The three degrees are positive (used to describe without comparing), comparative (used to compare two things), and
     superlative (used to compare three or more things).

 2. Explain how the three degrees of adjectives (positive, comparative, superlative) function to express varying levels of
    intensity or comparison. Use examples beyond those directly provided in the text.
 3. Analyze the different ways adjectives can be used to describe the same noun, focusing on how different types of adjectives
    alter the reader’s perception of that noun.
 4. Critically evaluate the claim that absolute adjectives cannot be compared, considering potential exceptions or nuances in
    usage.
 5. Develop an argument about the role of proper adjectives in shaping cultural perceptions of nouns, using examples not already
